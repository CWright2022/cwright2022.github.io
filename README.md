# **My Personal Website**  
This is my experiment with Github Pages, in an effort to get away from self-hosting my own Wordpress instance to increase availability. 

It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) combined with the [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) theme installed. It is still a work in progress until I fully remove my Wordpress site.
